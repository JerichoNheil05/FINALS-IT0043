        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>Embarking on my academic journey as a freshman BSIT student at the Far Eastern University Institute of Technology has been an exciting and transformative experience. The rigorous coursework, from mastering coding in C++ to understanding complex algorithms, presents constant challenges that ignite my passion for learning. One of my proudest achievements was creating a task scheduling program, which allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and enhance my problem-solving skills. Additionally, designing an online store for camera parts, which included detailed item names, descriptions, and images, combined my web development and photography interests, making my learning experience both practical and deeply satisfying. The blend of academic rigor and hands-on projects has provided me with a holistic education that goes beyond textbooks and lectures, shaping me into a well-rounded IT professional.</p>
